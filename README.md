This project aims to create a tool for online use that can take data generated through laser spectroscopy process it for exploritora data analysis and prediction. The description from Win Cowger, the project's sponsor, reads, 
    "The end goal is to develop a model which can be used to accurately predict any raw unprocessed spectrum. This model will speed up identification time and allow us to rapidly expand our resources. If we use an interpretable model, we may also be able to better understand which peaks are most important for identification. Ideally, the model accuracy will be greater than 90% which is the current accuracy of our default settings. This product is ripe for publication if we manage to pull it off and could have wide implications beyond Open Specy. The model will eventually be folded into the Open Specy package as a function (as long as the model file size isn't too large) and offered as a feature in the online version of the tool."
