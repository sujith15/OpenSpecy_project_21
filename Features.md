final feature (special case)
based on the guidance of the Code4Sac team from california, we created slightly trained a ML model which will be the main functionality of the system. we cannot test using this using travis ci in tandem with our main program, as the model uses resources directly from google colab. the model has been trained to over 50% accuracy initially.
